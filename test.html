<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will be completing the MMI from outside New Zealand, please email <a href='mailto:FMHSAdmission@auckland.ac.nz'>FMHSAdmission@auckland.ac.nz</a> to let us know which country you are in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kira Talent MMI Link</strong></p>
<p>You will receive an individual MMI link from Kira Talent once the interview schedule is finalised. We anticipate this notification process will commence on or around 10th November.</p>
<p>Please note that MAPAS applicants who are shortlisted for interview will receive TWO links: one from Kira Talent with the Faculty’s MMI link and one link directly from MAPAS for the MAPAS Specialty interviews. These will likely be scheduled for the same day.</p>
<p>There are certain actions you will need to take upon receipt of the Kira Talent MMI link (prior to your interview date) which includes the upload of a photograph, testing of your equipment, and a practice session so you become familiar with how the process will work. We recommend you use the computer/laptop and equipment you intend to use on the day, and that you undertake these tasks a few days before your interview. Failure to complete this Check In process will mean you cannot undertake your MMI.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are studying this semester and/or have not yet received your final grade(s), you have been invited to the MMI based on an interim GPA using optimal grades (i.e. A+ or equivalent) for the relevant courses. You should be aware that if your final GPA falls below the programme-specific interview threshold, you will no longer be eligible for consideration for final selection for that programme. The threshold for each programme will be determined by the Faculty Admissions Office once final grades are received and the entire application pool for 2023 entry is reviewed. Affected applicants will be notified by email.</p>
<hr /><h3><strong>DURING THE MMI</strong></h3><p>Please have your two forms of ID with you before you log into your Kira Talent MMI link. You must provide photographic proof of your identity as detailed above. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interview Structure:</strong></p>
<p>The synchronous or real-time model will be used in the Kira Talent platform. The interview component is comprised of 8 Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) stations. Each station has one interviewer and takes 8 minutes to complete. 7 of these stations will be assessed and have the following format:</p>
<ul>    <li><strong>2 minutes</strong> for the applicant to read and think over the given scenario and then </li>    <li><strong>6 minutes</strong> to discuss that scenario with the interviewer.</li></ul><p>An 8th station will be included as a point to carry out checks related to Police Vetting and the University’s obligations under the Children’s Act (2014). Once these checks have been completed (which should take no longer than a couple of minutes), you are free to use the remainder of the time in that station as a rest – you can go to the bathroom, have a drink etc.</p>
<p>Note that this rest station is part of the interview cycle, so it could fall anywhere from station 1 to 8. The total time to complete the MMI, including ID and technical checking processes, is just over an hour (approximately 65 minutes).</p>
<p>More information is available on our website, including a short video and examples of the types of scenarios that may be in your MMI, here: <a href='https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/fmhs/study-with-us/application-and-admission/mmi.html'>https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/fmhs/study-with-us/application-and-admission/mmi.html</a></p>
<p>Shortlisted candidates who apply to more than one of the professional programmes for 2023 entry will only be offered one MMI. Your MMI score will be used when final rankings are made for all programmes you have been invited to interview for.</p>
<p>All shortlisted applicants are required to undertake Police Vetting and a Children&rsquo;s Act check and interview.&nbsp; We require you to complete the forms listed prior to your interview, and at the rest station the interviewer will ask you some questions as part of the Children&rsquo;s Act checking process. The Ministry of Health website provides more information about why we undertake this process <a href='https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/health-workforce/childrens-worker-safety-checking-and-child-protection-policies#:~:text=What%20does%20the%20safety%20check%20involve%3F,identity%20verification).'>here</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to change your referee details after accepting the invitation, email your request to <a href='mailto:FMHSAdmission@auckland.ac.nz'>FMHSAdmission@auckland.ac.nz</a> with the subject line &ldquo;FMHS MMI Referee - Alteration Request&rdquo;.</p>
<hr /><h3><strong>AFTER THE MMI</strong></h3><p>Following your interview (and during all regular business hours), we will have Student Support Advisors from the Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences and MAPAS available if you need to talk to someone or debrief.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; these staff are not part of the clinical admissions process, and cannot provide any advice on anything around the likelihood of getting an offer, what your academic options might be etc. They are an independent person with whom you can debrief, if you need to. You can also do this with friends, whānau or colleagues. The interview process can be stressful, so we do encourage you to seek support, if you need it:&nbsp;<a href='mailto:fmhssupport@auckland.ac.nz'>fmhssupport@auckland.ac.nz.</a></p>
<p>Once all MMIs have been completed, the scores are collated and combined with the other elements for programme admission selection including final GPA and UCAT (if applicable), and all applicants will be ranked in their respective application categories.</p>
<p><strong>It is anticipated you will be advised of the outcome of your application(s) by 20 December 2022, through Student Services Online and by email.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

In addition, The Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences (FMHS) needs to assure Health Training Providers that students are safe to work in clinical environments.All students are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<hr /><p><strong>Confidentiality Agreement</strong></p>
